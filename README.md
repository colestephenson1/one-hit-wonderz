## Introduction
  - The goal of this group project was to create a React application and self learn the set up of a backend server. We wrote a dataset, connected it to  PostgreSQL using the ORM Knex, and deployed both the app and api using Heroku. 
  - Visit One Hit Wonders to see a list of six decades, which upon clicked, load ten inline Spotify elements that represent one hit wonders from that decade. The user can play the song from that element, click a link to visit the song's Spotify page, and can click buttons to filter by song mood or to see additional information about the song/artist.

## Technologies
  - React
  - JavaScript
  - postgreSQL
  - Knex

## Features
- Listen to the songs within the application through an embedded Spotify player.
